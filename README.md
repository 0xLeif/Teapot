# Teapot

*Serving tea to users in need*

## What is Teapot?

Teapot is a Vapor and Swift framework that uses the status code [418](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418), also known as "I'm a teapot". The Vapor framework contains a middleware that will return the status code of 418, unless there is a header named "isTea". The Swift framework contains extensions on URLRequest that add the required header needed.

## Why use Teapot?

**Teapot is a joke. Use it at your own discresion.**

Teapot is a simple framework to add a simple level of obscurity to your Vapor server. That is all.

> Security by obscurity alone is discouraged and not recommended by standards bodies. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States sometimes recommends against this practice: "System security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components."

    XCTAssertEqual(res.status, .imATeapot)
    XCTAssertNotEqual(res.body.string, "ðŸ«–")
}

let headers: HTTPHeaders = ["isTea": "true"]

try app.testable().test(.GET, "", headers: headers) { res in
    XCTAssertNotEqual(res.status, .imATeapot)
    XCTAssertEqual(res.body.string, "ðŸ«–")
}
```

### Swift URLRequest

```swift
